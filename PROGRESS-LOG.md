## 📅 WEEK 1 — Networking Fundamentals

### Day 1 — February 23, 2026
**Topics Covered:**
- OSI Model
- Wireshark Introduction

**What I Learned:**
- **DNS Packet:**
  - DNS server IP found: 81.50.109.10
  - Layer 4 protocol used: UDP
  - Port number: 53
- **TCP Handshake:**
  - Found it: Yes
  - Observations:
    - SYN → Client says "I want to connect, here is my sequence number"
    - SYN-ACK → Server says "Accepted. I acknowledge your sequence, here is mine"
    - ACK → Client says "Acknowledged. Connection established."
- **ICMP:**
  - Found it: No
  - Reason: No pinging occurred during the session

**Mistakes I Made & Corrections:**
- PDU at Layer 3 is PACKET not Segment ✅ corrected
